1.A) Create relational schemata from the above E/R diagram using the E/R-style translation. 
Indicate the key attributes by underlining them. Explain the need for each
of the schemata you create. If you join several entities into one relation, explain
why

Customer("name")
Ticket("Event", "ID", price)
Festivalticket("Event", "ID", Day)
Concertticket("Event", "ID", Seat No.)


1.B) Create relational schemata from the above E/R diagram using the object-oriented
translation. Indicate the key attributes by underlining them. Explain the need for
each of the schemata you create. If you join several entities into one relation, explain
why.

Customer("name")
Ticket("Event", "ID", price)
Festivalticket("Event", "ID", Price, Day)
Concertticket("Event", "ID", Price, Seat No.)


1.C) Create relational schemata from the above E/R diagram using the null translation.
Indicate the key attributes by underlining them. Explain the need for each of the
schemata you create. If you join several entities into one relation, explain why.

Customer("name")
Ticket("Event", "ID", price, Festivalticket, Concertticket)




2.A) Write an SQL SELECT query without subqueries, which lists the alcohol percentages
served from the red tap.

SELECT DISTINCT Alcohol FROM beers, taps WHERE beers.BeerID = taps.BeerID AND Tap = "red"


2.B) Write an SQL SELECT query with subqueries, which lists the names of all beers
that are not served from any taps.

SELECT Name FROM beers WHERE NOT EXISTS IN (SELECT DISTINCT BeerID FROM taps WHERE beers.BeerID = taps.BeerID)


2.C) Write an SQL SELECT query, which lists all taps together with the number of
different beers that they are connected to. There should be exactly one row for each
tap in the result.

SELECT tap, COUNT(DISTINCT BeerID) FROM taps GROUP BY tap




3.A) For each of the following expressions, give the resulting relation as a table similar
to the ones for R1 and R2 above.
1. σC>D(R2)
[A, C, D]
[1, 3, 2]

2. ΠB,C(R1)


3. R1 ./ R2
[A, B, C, D]
[1, 2, 3, 2]
